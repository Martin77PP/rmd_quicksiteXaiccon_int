## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
ID_5651 <- read_csv("inps/ID-5651.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(ID_5651, aes(`Posizione Prevalente`,Lavoratori)) + geom_col(aes(fill=Cittadinanza), position = "dodge") + facet_grid(vars(Anno))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
